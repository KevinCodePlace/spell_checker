It is a Streamlit app to show the spellchecker modified from Peter Norvig's [version](https://www.google.com/search?q=spell+checker+norvig&oq=spell+checker+norvig+&aqs=chrome..69i57j35i39j0i8i30l3.5766j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)

Also, you can type the word by your own.

Or If your word is incorrect, the spell checker will help you correct the word.
